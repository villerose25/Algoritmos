1 Initialize a queue
2 Enqueue initial node to the queue
3 Mark enqueued node as visited
4 Begin a loop that will go on as long  as the queue is not empty

Pseudocode
let Q be queue
Q.enqueue(s) / insert initial node in q
mark as visited

while(Q is not Empty)
v = Q.dequeue()

    for all neighbours n of v in Graph G
        if n is not visited
            Q.enqueue(n)
            mark n as visited

     Lopp 1
     enqueue 2 -> mark as visited
     1 -> mark as visited
     5 -> is not visited, mark as visited
